# Welcome to MikanDev!
I'm a random Japanese 16 year old that runs a tiny, one man development company, that creates things here and there, that I (think) are useful for the general public.<br>
**I have major Skill Issue syndrome, but I try my best to make cool stuff :)**<br><br>
![My Stuff](https://cdn.mikn.dev/branding/github/MyStuffBanner.png)
These are some of the projects that I have worked on over these years. They may be of dubious usefulness, but I hope you may find somrthing you like!
# Discord Bots
- I would post them here, but they are not working at this time. I do work on some of my [Partner Bots](#partners), so check them out!
# Websites
- [MikanDev Link Shortener](https://shortener.mikn.dev/) - Shorten those long links with a variety of cute domains (mostly Genshin ones), for free!
- [短縮.com (shorten dot com)](https://app.tanshuku.com/) - The **shortest** Japanese domain link shortener. Easy to use, free, and no ads!
- [Hikakin TV Everyday](https://hikakintvevery.day/) - A magical URL that will automatically redirect you to the latest video popular Japanese YouTuber HikakinTV posted!
